# Planets of Star Wars

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This project depcits information regarding the population, name, size, etc. of the 60 planets in the Star Wars universe. The two main components of this project are the bar chart and the table. The interactive bar chart allows the user to visualize the various data points pertaining to the planets. The data points the user can visualize are: population, orbital period, rotation period, surface water, and diameter. The paginated table allows the user to sort and sift through the data. 

## How to run

To run this, simply clone the repository to your local machine. Once cloned, be sure to run `npm install` in the project directory to download all necessary dependecies. Once the dependencies are installed, run `npm start`. This will open the project in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## How to Use

To use, simply interact with the chart by selecting what values to display using the dropdown on the left of the chart. To interact with the table, simply click on the column header values (Name, Population, etc.) to sort by ascending/descending order.
